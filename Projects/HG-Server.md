The free server

Written by gabriel

Origins
We had always played with the idea of having 
some sort of shared computer that we could do 
simple things with, such as hosting a website 
or a Minecraft server. We also wanted to build 
a PC together as we hadn't done that before. 
However, we didn't want to spend a whole bunch 
of money on a PC that didn't even need to be of 
the highest specs. 

The search for parts
During the Easter holidays, Henry and I had 
been doing some programming and software but we 
wanted to do something hardware wise. Henry 
then had the idea to go down to our local 
computer repair shop and ask if they had any 
old computer hardware that we could buy cheaply or 
get for free. We went there hoping for an old 
crappy motherboard or a HDD and did not expect 
a whole PC. When we arrived, we opened the 
door and saw two young men sitting behind the 
counter. Henry said, "We were wondering if 
you had any spare computer parts that we could 
get or buy?". Then one of the men turned to 
the other and said "Should we show them?". 
They then told us that they had a bunch of 
stuff they didn't need downstairs and were 
planning on throwing away that summer. 
They told us we could take whatever we wanted 
for our project. We were then shown down to 
the basement and we were greeted with a whole 
room full of computer parts. You could say it 
was a Tech oasis ;). We then proceeded to take 
a big Cooler Master case with some crappy 
hardware inside and we put in two monitors and a 
couple of keyboards. One of the men told us he 
had found a half decent motherboard with a CPU, 
GPU and some RAM already inside. We took those 
and brought them upstairs. They said they 
would test the power supply that was in the 
case and it was working fine. We thanked them 
several times, extremely chuffed with our 
find, and carried a heavy case full of things 
all the way back to Henry's house.

The assembly
As soon as we got back we rushed up to Henry's room and started unpacking. Everything was filthy and we spent a good hour or so cleaning everything up. When we finally had everything well cleaned, we started building our new PC. It took us an hour or so because we kept finding things to clean and polish! When everything was in the case we connected one of the monitors we had collected and pressed the power button. It miraculously posted first try without any issues. We then download Linux Mint onto a USB stick from Henry's laptop and installed it on our new computer. We created a user-account and download some basic applications. It was getting late so we called it a day and I headed home. If you want to see a tour of the PC and it's specs. click here.

Setting up the server
The following week we messed about with the PC. It ran pretty smoothly on Linux and no issues had occurred yet. We knew that we wanted it to be a server but we hadn't decided on what to do with it yet. Eventually we were torn between a website and a Minecraft server for all our friends to play on. We hadn't really started making a website and we weren't sure if we wanted to pay for a domain name. Because of this we decided to host a Minecraft server on the PC. We then searched up on how to do it on Linux Mint and set up and account dedicated to the server. We then used Henry's broadband IP and hosted our first Minecraft server. The PC managed to support around 5 people at a time and ran smoothly with minimal issues.

The issues
The server had been running smoothly for a couple of weeks but unfortunately some issues started to arise. The CPU that came with the motherboard had minimal thermal paste on and we were worried that we would start running into thermal issues. Henry managed to get his hands on some thermal paste and we applied some to the CPU. Unfortunately we forgot to clean it properly with alcohol and some of the old thermal paste was still on the chip. This resulted in the thermal paste not working properly and thermal issues started to begin. The CPU was running at 75 degrees centigrade when idle!  We had caused the thing that we had tried to avoid in the first place! We then cleaned it properly with ethanol and reapplied thermal paste. The thermal issue then disappeared. Another two weeks went by with no problems until the power supply fan started making weird squeaking noises and seemed to not be running properly. We shut the PC down and took a look at it. We got some lubricant and applied it to the fan. The fan stopped squeaking and no other issues seemed to come with it. The fan ran quietly for another week until it started making noises again. This time we didn't want to continue applying lube and risk a bigger problem being created, so we took a power supply from one of Henry's dad's old builds and put it in the server. The power supply worked brilliantly and no further issues popped up.

Where it is now
The PC is still working beautifully and is still hosting a Minecraft server that is used almost daily by friends and us. It is also taking part in the LTT folding project and is doing a decent job. That is going to be its use for now as we have other ways of hosting this website. We hope that you found this project interesting and that you are inspired to do something similar. Don't be shy! Go to your local computer repair shop and ask for some parts! If you want to read further about how our relationship with the store continued click here. Thanks for reading!
