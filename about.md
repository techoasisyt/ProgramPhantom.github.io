# About Tech Oasis

Tech Oasis was founded on the 5th of July 2019, by two boys Henry Varley and Gabriel Nilsson. 

## Origins 

---
Gabs and I had spent a while thinking about making a YouTube account to share our interest of tech with the rest of the world. We did so much cool stuff and thought if would amazing if we could show what we do with other people. 

### Name

The name "Tech Oasis" was originally Gaby's idea. We had spent a long time trying to figure out a name for everything, trust me, its pretty hard. There are so many other tech channels out there and we had to come up with something new, and something that didn't bare a ridiculous amount of cringe.

After Gaby came up with the name on the 5th, we searched YouTube to see if there were any other big tubers who already had it. Luckily, there only seemed to be a private company with a couple of subscribers that hadn't posted for 4 years. We took our chances.

### Early days

Later that day Gabriel and I preceded to making all the Social Media relating to Tech Oasis. Gabs made most of them, and that evening we had an account on most major platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and of course, YouTube.

### Channel Art

I made the channel art using a really old and bad version of Photoshop Elements (Photoshop Elements 6.0 to be exact). For the icon I used my Dad's old Cannon EOS 350D to take a picture of The GH-Server's dusty Intel stock CPU heatsink. The channel banner is a picture of the back of the server's graphics card, just behind the chip. I used the Cannon with a Macro lens to get that lovely close up shot. 

As for the text, we went on the website "Da Font" and found two fonts we liked. Then, we took screenshots of the text and put it in Photoshop. Gabs and I chose a Sci-Fi style font for "Tech", juxtaposed with a curvy, natural font for the "Oasis" part of Tech Oasis. We also chose matching colours to highlighting the difference in feel.

## Why we started

---
Gabriel and I had always loved technology. We love doing things like programming and have lots of fun doing anything on computers. Doing Python in school is one of our favourite activities and we starting programming at a young age. 

In our free time at home we fiddle with computery things all the time. We are taking computer science for GCSEs and we hope to continue to do computer things as a living in the future.

The reason we made Tech Oasis was to reach out and share our passion. We made it to inspire, make new friends, work together with new people, get help with our projects and generally make a nice community and get some good tech talk going!

Beyond that we also think making a repertoire of projects, with pages on our website and videos dedicated towards them, will be brilliant for getting jobs in the future - something to put on our CV maybe.

## What we do

On the Tech Oasis YouTube channel, you with find (hopefully) regular videos updating the community on the awesome things we have gotten up to in our spare time. Along with the videos, we might also make a page on our website dedicated to certain videos on our channel.

On our videos you will find us doing lost of different things such as

* Programming videos
* Programming tutorials
* Computer building videos
* Other tutorials
* Computer Science revision help
* And much, much more, anything we get interested in really!

### Quality

We have absolutely no experience in video making, all we have is other tech channel's videos to watch and learn from. However, we still try our very hardest to deliver the upmost quality to our viewers. Not having very good equipment will make it hard work, but we are determined to work with what we've got and make our videos entertaining.
